# Jacobi method

The jacobi finds the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the matrix A. The jacobi function accepts two three arguments, the square nxn matrices A and R and the dimension n.

To use this program you need to provide the matrix A and the matrix R. R can be random. This program change the provided matrices inplace and returns void.

To run:
Run from main.cpp. The main file contain a small test to verify that the jacobi method diagonalises the A matrix. 
To use it in other programs, import jacobi.h and compile as normal, all functions in jacobi.cpp is under the namespace jacobi.
