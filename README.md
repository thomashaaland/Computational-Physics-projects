# Fys4150

In the different folders are four different projects detailing some aspect in high performance computing especially useful in physics applications.

Projects for computational physics. 
* In the Jacobi folder are code in c++ for finding a diagonal decomposition of a given matrix such that $$A = R^TDR$$ where $A$ is an initial $n\times m$ matrix, $R$ is a $m\times n$ matrix and $D$ is a diagonal $m \times m$ matrix. 
* Project2 solves differential equations using matrix rotations.
* Project3 looks at improved numerical inegration methods.
* Project4 find the energy of a magnetized slab of metal.
